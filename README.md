Code Samples for ATMega 808-XFR Microcontroller

Welcome Internet Strangers! I recently started using the ATMega808-XFR microcontroller, which is part of the new AVR-0 Series from Microchip. This new series uses a different architecture, which basically means that everything I learned about how to program the older AVR microcontrollers doesn't work anymore. After looking around online I've found that there's not a whole lot of code samples out there for this new series of microcontrollers. As I've been experimenting with it, I've slowly figured out a few basic functions and plan to slowly build up some basic code samples to publish here.

These code samples are all intended for use with the ATMega808-XFR, but should probably work with any AVR-0 series chips. If it doesn't work, compare the datasheets to see what's different.

WARNING: I'm just some idiot on the internet with a desire to learn electronics and maybe help out some other people people along the way. There are probably much better ways of doing things than the methods you'll see here. These are just the ways I figured out how to do things by trial and error.
